## Stretch

### 1. Things to try

- Add a bunch more text fields
- Try adding more form elements that control appearance, for example:
  - a checkbox that 'features' the item in the list by highlighting it
  - a slider for color opacity
  - radio buttons for "will explode", "won't explode", "may explode (we're not sure)", etc
- If you're feeling ambitious, add a file upload component!
